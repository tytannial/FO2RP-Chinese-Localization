{300}{}{Hold on there. What do you think you're doing with that aircraft? There are no scheduled flights for several days.}
{301}{}{Nrg?}
{302}{}{I am aware of this.}
{303}{}{I'm sorry. I was just looking. I'll be going now.}
{304}{}{There's been a change of plans. I'm taking this aircraft.}

{310}{}{What? Oh, I see. Look, don't touch. Okay? Touch again and you die.}
{311}{}{(Smile then attack.)}
{312}{}{(Walk away.)}

{315}{}{Oh shit, looks like we got ourselves an intruder. Code Red! I repeat, code Red!}
{316}{}{That sounds like a good idea. Touch the aircraft again and I'll put a bullet in your head.}

{320}{}{Right. And therefore you are...}
{321}{}{About to leave. Sorry to bother you.}
{322}{}{About to deliver an important message to the main base.}
{323}{}{Oh, really? And what does this message say.}
{324}{}{It's super top secret. I cannot tell you.}
{325}{}{I'll tell you, but it's absolutely essential that you don't disclose this information to anyone else, for fear of a mass panic. You see, it's come to my attention that one of the recent shipments of slaves is infected with an unknown, and highly deadly, virus strain. I *must* get to the base immediately, or all our lives could be lost. Now stop wasting my time, as there isn't a moment to spare.}
{326}{}{Yeah, I believe you. Looks like we got ourselves an intruder...}
{327}{}{Damnit! Ah, whatever. I never get told shit around here. Fine. Be on your way.}
{328}{}{Woah, that sounds bad. You better get moving then, I don't want this shit on my hands. Oh, and don't worry, I won't tell anyone.}
{329}{}{[DONE]}

One of them does a double take at you then turns to the others.] Holy shit! One of those mutie wastlanders stowed away in the 'bird! ALERT! We got an intruder!}

{403}{}{[Raise hands in surrender and hope for the best.]}

{410}{}{Aw, it doesn't look like the mutie's gonna put up a fight. Maybe we should bring him to the Commander -- see what he wants to do about this.}

One of them does a double-take at you.] What the hell are you doing back here? You weren't authorized to be on that mission. What's your name, soldier?}
{421}{}{It doesn't matter what my name is, 'cause I'm not here to talk. [Jump out and start fighting.]}
{422}{}{Me? Oh, I'm, uh, *cough*mumble*cough*. Don't mind me, though. In fact, I should probably be going now. [Get out and attempt to walk away nonchalantly.]}
{423}{}{My name's }
{424}{}{. Where am I?}
{425}{}{No, what's *your* name, soldier? I was put here to test you and I gotta say you FAILED. If I were a wasteland suicide assassin you and your whole crew would be dead right now! That is unacceptable! Shape up, soldier!}
{426}{}{Uh . . . my name }
{427}{}{. I take fun ride in metal birdie! Go again! Wanna go again!}
{428}{}{You not need know my name. I no like you. I kill. [Jump out and start fighting.]}

{430}{}{What are you, drunk? You're at Navarro, of course. If you're having memory problems, soldier, you might wanna go get yourself checked out. Maybe some of that radiation out there got to you.}

{440}{}{Don't give me that bullshit. You're one of the new recruits, aren't you? Heh. That smart mouth of yours is gonna land you in all sorts of trouble--and I can't wait to see it happen. Now get back to your post, soldier.}

{450}{}{Sir! Yes sir!}
{451}{}{Ma'am! Yes ma'am!}

{460}{}{[The soldier looks at one of his comrades.] My God, contact with all the muties and radiation out there must have made him retarded. You see? *That's* why I never volunteer for those wasteland runs. Anyway, let's put this stupid bastard out of his misery before he contaminates us.}
