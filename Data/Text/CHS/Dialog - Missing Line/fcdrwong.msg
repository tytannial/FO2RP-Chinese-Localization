{100}{}{你看到一个很矮的始族人。}
{101}{}{你看到王宜慈博士。}
{102}{}{你看到一个很矮的始族人。}
{103}{}{我可以帮你什么吗？}
{104}{}{嗯嗯？}
{105}{}{你谁？}
{106}{}{我听说你有某个人的脾脏。}
{107}{}{你是谁？}
{108}{}{你在这边是干什么的？}
{109}{}{不，谢谢。就这样。}
{110}{}{我一定要承认，我不会说你的话。你应该要与李健谈谈，他会说各种不同的语言。}
{111}{}{啊！}
{112}{}{我是王博士。我是这边的主管科学家。}
{113}{}{更多的问题。}
{114}{}{谢谢，再见。}
{115}{}{我是负责监督这边科学实验的人。我也是负责这边电脑网路的人。}
{116}{}{你在计划着什么？}
{117}{}{要如何才能够进入电脑网路呢？}
{118}{}{我还有一些问题。}
{119}{}{我知道了，再见。}
{120}{}{啊，但如果我告诉你我的计划，那每一个人都会知道。那些计划是秘密的。}
{121}{}{好，好。我还有其它的问题。}
{122}{}{谢谢。再见。}
{123}{}{如果我用一把枪指着你逼你跟我说呢？}
{124}{}{如果你是说如何侵入电脑的话，你说我会不会找人把你杀了的呢？}
{125}{}{你不会真的把我杀掉了吧？}
{126}{}{也就是说你对我进入电脑不反对？}
{127}{}{我还有一些问题。}
{128}{}{你当然会。再见。}
{129}{}{那我就要把那种行为视为是一种威胁。}
{130}{}{让我们试试看吧。}
{131}{}{我只是开玩笑的。我还有一些问题。}
{132}{}{[他笑着] 我们一定要保护自己的。}
{133}{}{嗯，对。对于我进入电脑，你会反对吗？}
{134}{}{对。我还有一些其它的问题。}
{135}{}{再见。}
{136}{}{如果你有办法说服我的手下让你进去的话．．}
{137}{}{如果我用一把枪指着你呢？}
{138}{}{很好。我还有更多的问题。}
{139}{}{嗯。我知道了，再见。}
{140}{}{嗯，对！}
{141}{}{你还有吗？很好，基特需要它。}
{142}{}{那是一个人的脾脏啊，你这疯子！}
{143}{}{你知道那酒是要配肝，而不是脾脏的，对不对？}
{144}{}{你知道那是一个人的脾脏，对不对。}
{145}{}{谁是基德啊？现在那是我的脾脏了，我要把它当晚餐吃了。}
{146}{}{基德是那脾脏原来的主人。他喝醉了并且把它不小心卖给了朱流。}
{147}{}{他需要那脾脏才能够活下去，你知道吗？那是从他的身体内取出来的。}
{148}{}{那我看我把你杀了之后再把它取回好了。}
{149}{}{卖了就是卖了。他不能拿回去了。抱歉，基德只好没有脾了。}
{150}{}{[更多]}
{151}{}{那是一个人的脾脏？朱流并没有跟我说呀！}
{152}{}{不过由于你那样的不客气，我决定拿它来做实验。}
{153}{}{告诉你的朋友叫他在明天之前来，我会很高兴的还他的。我希望你能够及时的把它装回去。}
{154}{}{很好。}
{155}{}{哈哈！我也看过那部电影。等一下．．你在说什么？你是说．．？}
{156}{}{是的，那是一个人的脾脏。}
{157}{}{事实上，你这个人态度很不好，因此我不跟你说话了。再见。}
{158}{}{[完成]}
{159}{}{啊！卫兵！有个老外入侵者在这里！}
{160}{}{你有什么设计图要给我吗？}
{161}{}{李健叫我马上将这些东西给你。}
{162}{}{是的，我应该到那里拿？}
{163}{}{不，还没有。}
{164}{}{去与李健谈，他会告诉你你未来会发生什么事的。谢谢你，运用这些我们应该能够确定我们的实验资料的。再见。}
{165}{}{我还有一些问题。}
{166}{}{再见。}

{200}{}{I found this corpse stashed over at the Hubologists' base. I believe it might be your missing Xeno Project specimen.}
{201}{}{Yes, it is indeed! My predecessor had much invested in this subject and was quite distressed when it went missing. Although he is now gone, we still may have some use for this specimen. Thank you for retrieving this.}
{202}{}{No problem. See you later.}
{203}{}{Hold on there. No one said I did this for free.}
{204}{}{Correct. Nor did anyone ask you to retrieve the subject. You did that and brought it here of your own volition. Now the stolen subject has been returned to its rightful owners, and we thank you for it.}
{205}{}{That's nice, but I found it, so if you want it back, then it's going to cost you.}
{206}{}{I don't have time for this...Guards!}
{207}{}{[The man looks like he is about to yell, then calms down.] Fine. Here is $500. More than enough for something that always belonged to us. Now leave, I'm a busy man.}
{208}{}{Pleasure doing business with you. Bye.}
{209}{}{Oh, shit!}
{210}{}{Let's dance!}
{211}{}{You recover the missing Xeno Program specimen.}
{220}{}{So where is it then? Are you trying to play games with me?}
{221}{}{Sorry, I like to try and hoard as many items as I can. It's kinda my thing.}
{230}{}{I don't have time for this. Come back when you have the specimen.}

{240}{}{[He sniffs the air.] What is that smell? Like rotten meat. [He looks at you and raises an eyebrow.]}
{241}{}{Oh, you must be smelling this body I found. I'm not really sure why I'm carrying it around, to be honest.}
{242}{}{Huh-huh! [You pull out the decomposing corpse] Stinky body! U want?}

{250}{}{Wait a second, that's the subject from the Xeno Project! My predecessor had much invested in this subject and was quite distressed when it went missing. Although he is now gone, we still may have some use for this subject. Thank you.}
{251}{}{No, I do not want― Wait a second, that's the subject from the Xeno Project! My predecessor had much invested in . . . [He notices your blank stare.] Ahem. I mean, thank you for the body. Good job. Don't bring any more though. This is enough. Bye now!}
{252}{}{Bye Bye!}
{253}{}{Me hoard tings. Me hide it.}

#dr sheng begin
{300}{}{So what's the deal with this Dr. Sheng?}

{310}{}{How do you know about Dr. Sheng? Eh, I suppose it doesn't matter. Dr. Sheng Ming was a brilliant, but rather unpleasant man who served as my predecessor. He is no longer of any great relevance here.}
{311}{}{Well if he's not relevant to you, then why should *I* care? Let me ask you something else.}
{312}{}{So what happened to him?}

{320}{}{What happened? I'd say he lost his mind. During his experiments he stumbled upon something which I admit was rather remarkable, but it was also extremely dangerous and in no way related to the goals of the Shi. But that did not matter to Dr. Sheng. He became obsessed with his creation and since his experiments were deemed too dangerous to continue here, he decided to take them elsewhere. He left on sabbatical and never returned. That is when I stepped up to fill his position.}
{321}{}{What kind of experiments was Dr. Sheng performing? And what exactly was his big discovery?}
{322}{}{So where is Dr. Sheng now?}

{330}{}{As a man of science, I respect your inquisitive nature. However, I'm afraid I am not willing to share the secrets of the Shi with you, stranger.}
{331}{}{So where is Dr. Sheng now?}
{332}{}{Fine, you keep your fancy secrets. I have secrets of my own, you know. Better secrets than you could ever possibly imagine.}

{340}{}{[He smiles politely.] I'm sure you do. Now if you will excuse me, I have plenty of work that needs doing. Good day.}
{341}{}{[DONE]}

{350}{}{Dr. Sheng was escorted a day or so to the south. He took up residence in some abandoned home, if I'm not mistaken. He was only supposed to be gone for a month, but it's been much longer and we have yet to hear from him. If I were to guess, I would say he was either destroyed by his own creations, or else fell victim to the numerous hazards of the wasteland.}
{351}{}{One of your lead scientists could be dead, and you don't care? You're not even going to go look into it?}
{352}{}{I think I'd like follow up on this Dr. Sheng guy. Could you give me his last known location?}
{353}{}{Well, that's that. Let me ask you something else.}

{360}{}{You'll have to excuse me for seeming so callous about the matter. The truth is, Dr. Sheng was not very popular around here and I do not believe any of us miss him in the slightest.}
{361}{}{I think I'd like follow up on this Dr. Sheng guy. Could you give me his last known location?}
{362}{}{I see. Let me ask you something else.}

{370}{}{I suppose I could... I must admit I am somewhat curious to learn of his fate. Here, I'll mark Dr. Sheng's last known location on your mapping device. But I must warn you that it could prove to be highly dangerous. Of course, it is always dangerous out there in the wastes. Anyway, if you find something of interest, do let me know.}
{371}{}{Thanks, I'll do that. Bye.}
{372}{}{Let me ask you something else.}

{380}{}{Dr. Sheng is still alive and he's created some kind of plant that takes root in and controls human corpses.}

{390}{}{So he has achieved some success with his Xeno Project. How fascinating ... and disturbing. We put an end to his sentient plant experiments here after we lost one our techs. When he left to continue his research, I assumed he'd fall victim to his own creations. Has he managed to assume some form of control over them?}
{391}{}{Yeah, some of them seem to be subservient. They even refer to him as 'master.'}

{400}{}{Hmm… If he were to somehow establish an army of those plant-creatures, that would not bode well for the Shi. I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but it seems we have no choice but to ensure that Dr. Sheng and his experiments are eliminated. Since he trusts you enough to allow you get close to him, you are the best candidate. Is that something you'd be willing to do? You would be compensated, of course.}
{401}{}{It'd be a pleasure. The guy and his whole operation creeps me out.}
{402}{}{What kind of compensation are we talking here?}
{403}{}{Not interested. Dr. Sheng's your problem―you guys can deal with him.}

{410}{}{The Shi will be most grateful for this service. Once Dr. Sheng and all of his creations have been eliminated, report back to me to receive your reward.}
{411}{}{[DONE]}

{420}{}{I'll leave that up to you. We could grant you weapons, supplies, or money. You may decide once the task is complete.}
{421}{}{All right. I'll do it.}
{422}{}{Not interested. Dr. Sheng's your problem―you guys can deal with him.}
{423}{}{All right. I'll do it. But before I go, Dr. Sheng wanted me to deliver this plant sample to you. He said it should help you achieve the goal of creating radiation-resistant plant life.}

{430}{}{Fair enough. We will handle the problem ourselves, but it will have to wait, as we don't have the resources to expend at the moment. Hopefully it won't be too late once we are able to act. In the meantime, if you should change your mind, please let me know.}
{431}{}{Don't count on it. Bye.}
{432}{}{I'll think about it. Bye.}
{433}{}{We'll see. Let me ask you something else.}

{440}{}{I don't suppose you have changed your mind? Will you help us eliminate Dr. Sheng and his creations?}
{441}{}{Nope, I actually wanted to ask you about something else.}
{442}{}{Alright, I'll take him out for you.}
{443}{}{I'll do it, but for a price. You were talking about compensation before?}

{450}{}{Our scouts have reported that Dr. Sheng and his experiments have been destroyed. Such a waste of a brilliant mind… Anyway, you may claim your reward. Are you interested in weapons, supplies, or cash?}
{451}{}{Our scouts have reported that Dr. Sheng and his experiments have been destroyed. Such a waste of a brilliant mind… Anyway, we never asked you to get so involved, but we are grateful. For your troubles, you may claim a reward. Are you interested in weapons, supplies, or cash?}
{452}{}{I'll take weapons.}
{453}{}{I could always use more supplies.}
{454}{}{Just give me money.}
{455}{}{Keep your reward. I only did it because it was the right thing to do.}

{460}{}{Here you go. [He hands various high powered weapons]}
{461}{}{[DONE]}

{470}{}{Here you go. [He hands you various supplies]}
{471}{}{[DONE]}

{480}{}{Here you go. [He hands you $5,000]}
{481}{}{[DONE]}

{490}{}{The Shi appreciates your assistance. Now, I have much work to do. Good day.}
{491}{}{[DONE]}

{500}{}{Before I go, Dr. Sheng wanted me to deliver this plant sample to you. He said it should help you achieve the goal of creating radiation-resistant plant life.}
{501}{}{Dr. Sheng wanted me to deliver this plant sample to you. He said it should help you achieve the goal of creating radiation-resistant plant life.}
{502}{}{Dr. Sheng wanted me to give you this plant sample as a gift, but I thought I should warn you that it's infused with his sentience serum. I don't know what it's supposed to do, but I'm pretty sure it won't be good for the Shi.}

{510}{}{Interesting. [He takes the sample and stores it away.] My team and I will examine it later. I can't say I trust any gift from Dr. Sheng, but I suppose there is an off chance that it'll prove useful. We shall see. Now if there is nothing else, I should be getting back to work.}
{511}{}{Interesting. [He takes the sample and stores it away.] My team and I will examine it later. I can't say I trust any gift from Dr. Sheng, but I suppose there is an off chance that it'll prove useful. We shall see. But I thought you were going to eliminate Dr. Sheng, not be his courier? In any case, I should be getting back to work.}
{512}{}{Actually, I would like to ask you something else.}
{513}{}{Goodbye.}
{514}{}{Actually, I went through quite a bit of trouble to get that sample for you. I think it's worth a reward.}

{520}{}{Do you, now? The Shi did not solicit this plant sample from you, but if you feel your deeds have earned some compensation, I suppose we could spare this. [He hands you a super stimpak.] Now I really should be getting back to work.}
{521}{}{Actually, I would like to ask you something else.}
{522}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{523}{}{Really? You call this a reward? I'm gonna knock you around until something more valuable falls out.}

{530}{}{[Takes the seed.] Thank you, I will dispose of this immediately. [He sighs.] I knew Dr. Sheng had lost it, but I didn't think he'd go so far as to try and destroy his own people. He must be dealt with immediately.}
{531}{}{I agree. He's quite the madman.}

{540}{}{*clutches heart* Wahh.}
{541}{}{Urgh.}
{542}{}{Dr. Wong!}

{600}{}{You eliminate Dr. Sheng for the Shi.}
{601}{}{You deliver the plant sample to Dr. Wong.}
{602}{}{You assassinate Dr. Wong.}
