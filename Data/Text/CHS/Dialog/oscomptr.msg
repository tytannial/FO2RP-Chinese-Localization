#Vault 13 Timeline
#{270}{}{As you read over the beginning of the timeline, you find it interesting that no reason is given for why the Vault didn't open 10 years after the Great War, as it was originally designed to. }
{270}{}{你从避难所历史记录的未尾开始阅读，你发现让人感到困惑的是，在第一次世界大战之后的10年这个避难所的大门并没有被打开，这与它最初的设计目标不符。但对这件事，你在历史记录找不到任何的解释。}
{271}{}{[更多]}

#{272}{}{Browsing ahead, you don't find much of interest until the year 2161, when the Vault's only working water chip breaks down. You feel a surge of pride as you read about your grandfather being selected for the important task of leaving the Vault and scouring the wasteland for a replacement water chip. However, it feels a little odd seeing your tribe's most revered legend told in a simple bullet point format.}
{272}{}{[再往前看，你发现更多你感兴趣的东西]2161年，13号避难所唯一的净水晶片损坏，你的祖父被挑选出来离开这座活人墓在废土上寻找替代的净水晶片。[读到这里你感到一阵骄傲]但是，你看到你的部落最受人尊敬的传奇人物，在这份历史记录里竟然只有轻描淡写的记录，你感到很奇怪。}
{273}{}{[更多]}

#{274}{}{Continuing down the timeline, you read of your grandfather's success and subsequent exile, and how several other vault dwellers chose to join him rather than remain in the relative safety of the Vault. You also discover that the Overseer was eventually tried and executed by the remaining vault dwellers.}

#{332}{}{Let it be known that I took little joy in exiling our "great hero", but I had no choice in the matter. His adventures in the outside world had changed him too much. He was too great a threat to the project. Had I let him remain among us, he might have uncovered the true nature of the Vaults and jeopardized the experiment. Even if he didn't, he'd at least inspire others to venture outside, which would be just as bad.}
{332}{}{事实上，我也为拯救我们的“伟大的英雄”而欢欣鼓舞。但在这件事上我没有选择，他在外面世界的冒险经历已经改变他太多了，他对这个项目的威胁太大了。如果我让他继续留在我们中间，他可能会知道并向人们揭示避难所的本质，并危及整个实验。即使他没有这样做，他至少也会鼓励其他人去外面冒险，这也同样糟糕。}
{333}{}{[更多]}
#{334}{}{He simply had to go. There was no other option. But even that wasn't enough. No, I'm afraid the damage had already been done. I allowed his most stubborn supporters to follow him into exile, and then tried to reassert my control over those who remained. But it was no use -- I'd already been vilified. So be it. The only thing I'm guilty of is an entire lifetime of carrying out the demands of our Great Nation.}
{334}{}{我必须让他离开，没有别的选择，但这还不够。恐怕我担心的事情已经在逐渐蔓延了。我让他最顽固的支持者跟着他离开，然后试图控制局面，向那些留下来的人重新灌输“外界很危险”的信息。但是我知道这不会有很大的效果，我的公信力已经受到质疑了。我这辈子唯一的罪过就是一生都在履行我们伟大国家的要求。}
{335}{}{[更多]}
#{336}{}{My only regret is that Vault 13 is not likely to complete the social experiment. Once I've been disposed of, I feel certain the others will leave the Vault. Not right away, of course -- I've instilled too much fear in them of the outside world. But eventually, they're bound to overcome that fear. I have very little faith that Vault 13 will remained closed until 2277, as the experiment dictates.}
{336}{}{我唯一的遗憾是13号避难所恐怕不太可能完成“社会保存计划”了。一旦我被处决了，我相信剩下的人都会离开避难所。当然，他们应该不会马上就离开，因为我给他们灌输了很多关于外部世界的恐惧。但最终他们一定会克服这种恐惧，13号避难所应该不会坚持封闭到实验所规定的2277年了。}

{361}{}{[更多]}
#{362}{}{Incredibly, all 122 of Vault-Tec's public Vaults were part of a grand social experiment orchestrated by the US government. Only 17 of those Vaults, dubbed "control Vaults", were designed to function correctly [it seems Vault 8 was one of the lucky few]. The rest were meant to have various critical flaws, so that the government could study the pre-selected occupants, and see how they react to the stresses of their situations, and how well they're able to re-colonize once their Vaults open.}
{362}{}{你搜索到的信息简直令人难以置信，在全部122个避难所中，所有的公共避难所都是由美国政府精心策划的大型社会实验的一部分。只有17个被称为“控制端”的避难所被设计成正确的功能[似乎8号避难所是少数幸运儿之一]。其余的则故意在建造时留下各种各样的缺陷，这样政府就可以研究这些预先选定的住户，看看他们如何应对他们所面临的压力，以及一旦他们的避难所打开，他们又能如何重新开始地面生活。而最终这些避难所成功与否，实验者都不关心，美国政府关心的是“如果地球被毁了，之后我们到另一个星球该如何定居”，避难所实验只是这个计划的其中一环。}
{363}{}{[更多]}
#{364}{}{It seems Vault 13's role in the experiment was to remain closed for 200 years to test the effects of prolonged isolation. Apparently, the breaking down of the water chip was un-intended, and forced the Overseer to improvise by selecting your grandfather to go out and fetch a new chip. After some more digging around, you manage to find descriptions of some of other Vault experiments.}
{364}{}{在这个实验中，13号避难所的作用似乎并不是封闭10年，而是保持封闭200年，以测试长期隔离的效果。显然，净水水晶片是意料之外的事情，这迫使监督者通过选择你的祖先去拿一个新的芯片来临时凑合。在进行了更多的挖掘之后，你可以找到一些关于其他避难所实验的描述。}
{365}{}{[更多]}
#{366}{}{Vault 12's door was designed never to close, so that the assholes behind this experiment could "study the effects of radiation on the selected population". If you recall the legend correctly, Vault 12 was located under the ghoul filled city of Necropolis, where the Vault Dweller finally found the water chip. It seems quite likely that the ghouls were the result of this experiment.}
{366}{}{12号避难所的门从来没有关闭过，所以这个实验背后的混蛋可以“研究辐射对所选人群的影响”。你回想起祖父的传奇，12号避难所就坐落在一个充满僵尸的城市里，被流放者终于找到了净水晶片。食尸鬼似乎很可能就是这次实验的结果。}
{367}{}{[更多]}
#{368}{}{Vault 15, another key location in the Vault Dweller's quest, was to be populated by people with "radically diverse ideologies" that would be sealed in the Vault together for 50 years. Vault 27 was to be purposely overcrowded with 2,000 people -- double the maximum capacity. That couldn't have been pretty. Vault 29 was to be populated only by those under the age of sixteen, with their parents "purposely redirected to other Vaults".}
{368}{}{15号避难所是“避难所文化融合探索”的实验地点，它的居民是文化与意识形态之间存在着极端剧烈的冲突的人，他们将在一起被封存50年，以观察在数十个乃至数百个不同文化之间的融合或者冲突。27号避难所容纳的人口数被故意超过其能容纳的限度，足足有2000人，是最大容量的两倍。避难所29号的居民均不超过15岁,他们的父母都被有意的安排到了其他的避难所，避难所用一部ZAX超级电脑代替人工控制，电脑依靠机器人助手来治疗和抚养儿童，给予他们基础教育，待孩子成年后逐步将他们释入一个可控环境。观察他们回到地面后，是否能够重建社会。}
{369}{}{[更多]}
#{370}{}{Vault 34's experiment involved an armory overstocked with weapons and ammo, and, of course, not provided with a lock. How pleasant. Vault 36 suffered from food extruders that were designed to produce only "a thin, watery gruel", while Vault 42 was outfitted only with dim lighting―no light bulbs of over 40 watts were provided.}
{370}{}{34号避难所内储存了大量的武器,但在这个避难所中并没有一把锁。36号避难所的食品生产机被设计成只能生产一种“极其稀薄”的流质食品。而42号避难所只配备了昏暗的照明――这个避难所里没有超过40瓦的灯泡。}
{371}{}{[更多]}
#{372}{}{Vault 53's equipment was designed to break down every few months. While repairable, the constant breakdowns were meant to test the stress of the inhabitants. You wonder how many expert mechanics and technicians that Vault produced. Vault 55 would have all its entertainment tapes removed, while Vault 56 would have all its entertainment tapes removed, with the exception of one featuring a particularly bad comic actor.}
{372}{}{53号避难所绝大部分设备被设计为每几个月就瘫痪一次.但都是可修复的，这种瘫痪旨在用来给避难所居民不定期地增加压力。56号避难所里除了一个非常蹩脚的喜剧演员主演的影片之外，没有一点娱乐媒介。社会学家们认为这个避难所将会先于55号避难所崩溃。}

You can only imagine the horrors that took place there……Vault 69, on the other hand, was to be occupied by 999 females and only one male……interesting. Vault 70's jumpsuit extruders were designed to fail after 6 months. And finally, Vault 106 was designed so that 10 days after being sealed, it would begin "releasing psychoactive drugs into the air filtration system".}
